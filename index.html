<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
    I am a Software Development Manager and an AIML enthusiast. With a strong passion for technology and artificial intelligence, I strive to push the boundaries of what's possible in the world of software development.
</p>

<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<p>
    In my free time, I enjoy engaging in various hobbies that help me unwind and broaden my horizons. Sports, travel, and movies are three activities that I find particularly fascinating.
</p>

<h3>Sports</h3>
<p>
    Sports not only keep me physically active but also teach me valuable lessons about teamwork, dedication, and perseverance. Whether it's playing a friendly game of basketball with friends or hitting the gym, I find sports to be a great way to stay fit and relieve stress.
</p>

<h3>Travel</h3>
<p>
    Exploring new places and experiencing different cultures is a true passion of mine. I believe that travel broadens the mind and provides unique perspectives that can't be gained elsewhere. From hiking through breathtaking landscapes to immersing myself in the local customs and traditions, every journey is an opportunity for personal growth and discovery.
</p>

<h3>Movies</h3>
<p>
    Movies are not just a form of entertainment for me; they are a source of inspiration and creativity. I enjoy a wide range of genres, from thought-provoking dramas to thrilling action films. Watching movies allows me to escape into different worlds and gain insights into the human condition.
